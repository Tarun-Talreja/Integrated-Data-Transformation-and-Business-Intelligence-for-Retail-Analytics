# Integrated Data Transformation and Business Intelligence for Retail Analytics

## Overview
This project involved leading the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of data from multiple MySQL databases into a SQL Server Data Warehouse. Advanced dimension modeling and surrogate key pipelining strategies were employed to optimize data transformation and loading processes. The project culminated in the integration of SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) with Power BI to create dynamic dashboards that provided critical insights on Return on Investment (ROI), inventory turnover, and customer profit analysis.
